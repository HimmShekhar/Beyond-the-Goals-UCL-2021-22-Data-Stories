# Beyond-the-Goals-UCL-2021-22-Data-Stories
Excited to share a Tableau project where I delved into the heart of the UEFA Champions League 2021-22 season! 🏆✨

Check out the interactive dashboard on Tableau Public: https://lnkd.in/eEyrmck5

In this exploration, I wanted to capture the essence of the tournament through insightful data analysis and storytelling. 📈 From goal distribution to player contributions and match outcomes, the dashboard provides a comprehensive snapshot of the season.

While my focus was on UCL goals, the world of football analytics is vast, and there are endless avenues to explore – from team strategies to individual player trajectories. ⚡️⚽
